# Invariant-Mass-Predictor
Deep learning model to predict and calculate invariant mass when electrons collide. 


I used a dataset found on Kaggle that was taken from Cern to train the models, I reached a mean square error as low as 0.3 and it can be trained fairly quickly compared to other models of the same type. It was made to be published in a scientific article but anyone can use the models freely.
